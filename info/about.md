# About All This

[Feral Machines](http://feralmachin.es), a blog that stumbles erratically
between computer science, philosophy, and utter confabulation, and 
[P'log](https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/plog), a
blogging server, implemented in Prolog, are both written and maintained by Lucca
Fraser, who lives in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

You can reach her by email, and, if you like, submit comments to the blog,
