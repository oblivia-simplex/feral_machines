# About All This

[Feral Machines](http://feralmachin.es), the blog you're visiting, and [P'log](https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/plog), the blogging server software that it runs on, are both written and maintained by me, Lucca Fraser. You can reach me by email, and, if you like, submit comments to the blog, at `feral` dot `machines` at `bastardi` dot `net`.

There isn't much of a theme to this blog. The texts here, so far, range over philosophy, computer science, poetry, fiction, casual musings, music, jokes. I don't have any clear idea of who the audience for all this could be.

As of [January, 2022](new_years_resolution_2022.md), you can expect to start seeing some short fiction, here, on a monthly basis. I'm holding myself to it.
