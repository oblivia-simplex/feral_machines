# About All This

[Feral Machines](http://feralmachin.es), the blog you're visiting, is run by Olivia Lucca Fraser, with occasional contributions by Molly Saltzman. [P'log](https://github.com/oblivia-simplex/plog), the blogging server software that that this blog runs on, is written and maintained by Lucca. You can reach us by email, and, if you like, submit comments to the blog, at `feral` dot `machines` at `barnacle` dot `fish`.

There isn't much of a theme to this blog. The texts here, so far, range over philosophy, computer science, poetry, fiction, casual musings, music, jokes. I don't have any clear idea of who the audience for all this could be.
