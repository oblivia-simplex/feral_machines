To a smaller than average man -stretched out in the crease of her tongue with his heel hooked lazily over his ankle, leaning back, palms flat, idly massaging the shag of papillae with his fingers running between them -to him, the view would be beautiful. The rusty bluffs of teeth above -he couldn’t see the lower row, on account of the bulk of the tongue -would have parted directly before him. And being the only soul sitting right there, it’d feel -he’d know it isn’t so, but it would *feel* -like they’d parted just for him, so that he could see what he would see: one lip eclipsing the earth below, the other wrapped around heaven in its trembling emerald firmanent. The vapours would sting his eyes and so he’d blink them hard and fast. They’d water a bit, which would help. Light would play on the cosmic glass and warp as the universe tilted. He’d have to shift his weight back to his palms, and clench fistfuls of taste buds to keep from slipping. But not because he’s afraid of dying. He would be afraid, of course, like anyone would be, but he’d know where he is and why. He’d know what’s going to happen. He’d’ve found his steel. He’d breathe in through his nose, and out through his mouth and he might be getting a little lightheaded but his sinuses would be clear. He’d think of the day his son had brought him to a Turkish bath in the city, and the bowl of eucalyptus oil that wobbled the light on the tiles. His thoughts would clear. He’d breathe in through his nose and out through his mouth. It wouldn’t be that he wasn’t afraid. He’d just want to meet it calm and alert, and not scurry away from the beauty of it like he had somewhere better to be. As the slope of heaven grew steeper he would brace himself, pause, let his muscles go slack, and allow his body to yield. Without closing his eyes or clouding his view he’d imagine his skin sloughing away and the cage of his chest hatching open. When the golden river poured in at last he’d surrender without hesitation.

But there was less than a sip in there left.

He’d barely’ve gotten wet.

Shalim lobbed the Great White empty to the heap of clothes in the corner and stood. This proved overambitious. She sat back down on the air mattress that had deflated overnight and put her head between her knees. Her bowels squealed and squirmed at the pressure. She sprawled savasana and counted her breaths. She got back to her feet, moving slowly and leaning against the wall for support. She squinted. The sun was at its winter peak and cut through the glass at eye level. She stumbled across the living room to the clothes heaped in the corner. Patches of carpet were wet. A CD case crunched underfoot. She patted down the faux fur coat on top till she found a pair of sunglasses, Mike’s. They gave him a feminine, buglike look. She put them on. They helped. The green glass bottle with the shark on the label had rolled to the side of the pile. Her throat was parched and her tongue felt thick so she took it and made her way to the kitchen.

The dishes were piled high in the sink, with an unfinished bowl of cereal wedged right underneath the spout. She loosened a plate from beneath the bowl and ceramic ground on ceramic. A white-winged moth on its back in the milk flailed its miniscule legs.
