abstract: A poem I write a few years back -- I think it was in 2014.

<br>

My life has laid disastrously<br>
in yellowed egg-foam scenes of betrayal & delight<br>

where I took you in my core<br>
where I held you till the skin broke.<br>

<br>

You thickened your fist in the summer,<br>
cartilage shot<br>
from the long days cleaning your bomb.<br>

<br>

There are knuckles on the branch, still,<br>
spelling ransom notes with scrabble tiles.<br>
There are coyotes in the yard.<br>
There are ghosts in the anthills.<br>

<br>

We could smell winter end from your window<br>

the fruit that fell in autumn,<br>
the pulp beneath the snow.<br>

The cider cans hush as you pad past the sill,<br>
& look for snipers in the mountains.<br>

<br>

I wash dishes as my hair dries,<br>
without habit or routine.<br>
The floor's beneath my feet<br>
& as clean as a hydrogen bomb.<br>

<br>

I held you in my core till the skin broke,<br>
but I only held my core by the stem.<br>

<br>
