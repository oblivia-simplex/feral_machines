## The Sentence is a Lonely Place

I don’t remember exactly when -- though it probably wasn’t long after I’d read the first story in *Worsted* -- I found myself reading Garielle Lutz’s essay on composition, [The Sentence is a Lonely Place](https://culture.org/the-sentence-is-a-lonely-place/). Lutz traces much of her craft back to Gordon Lish’s teaching.

%% Quote and discuss Lutz’s remarks here %%

[Elsewhere](https://www.tumblr.com/litafficionado/662801700743168001/four-questions-with-garielle-lutz) Lutz talks about how she attended Lish’s writing classes,

> and tried to grasp, to the best of my abilities, the things he was saying about how to get from one word to the next.  He also talked about how to free a word from the constricting range of its permissible behaviors, how to drain it of every sepsis of received meaning, until there is nothing left of the word but the skeleton of its former self, just the lank, gawky letters sticking out this way and that, and then how to fill the thing up again, to the point of overspilling, but this time with something that would never have been allowed to belong in there before, and then see whether the word, now close to bursting, can hold up and maybe have a new kind of say.

## Lish and Carver

My curiosity in Lish was first piqued when I read Raymond Carver last year (or maybe the year before?), followed by a few scholarly papers on his dynamic with his editor, Lish. (Adele Tutter’s [What the Story is About: Carver, Lish, and the Editorial Process](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2167-4086.2009.tb00402.x) comes to mind.) I kept tripping over citations of Carol Polsgrove’s [observations](https://carolpolsgrove.com/excerpton-gordon-lish-at-esquire/), in her history of *Esquire* in the ’60s, on the extent of Lish’s editorial interventions. Lish was an aggressive editor, in the sense that you might speak of an “aggressive” plastic surgeon. %% He was an editor for whom editing took part in the literary act of creation. %% Polsgrove describes the case of “Neighbors”, the first story Carver would publish in *Esquire*, under Lish’s editorial oversight. “On several pages of the twelve-page manuscript,” she says,

> fewer than half of Carver’s words were left standing. Close to half were cut on several other pages.. … In some parts he threaded out phrases and sentences; in others he took out entire paragraphs. The cuts gave the story a dry, minimalist feel [and] a flat ironic style.

In his long autobiographical interview in the *Paris Review*, [Paris Review - The Art of Editing No. 2](https://theparisreview.org/interviews/6423/the-art-of-editing-no-2-gordon-lish), Lish says,

> I saw in Carver’s pieces something I could fuck around with. There was a prospect there, certainly. The germ of the thing, in Ray’s stuff, was ­revealed in the catalogue of his experience. It had that promise in it, something I could fool with and make something new seeming. “Fat” was the first one I revised, but Gingrich nixed it. I got it into *Harper’s Bazaar*.

And a little later,

> I can’t believe that what I had in my hands from Ray would have made its way into the hearts of those who have apparently been so ­undone by the work. Which work had been deformed, reformed, tampered with in every respect by, yeah, me. Contaminated, uncontaminated, that’s a discrete consideration. But readers were seduced, and, I’m sorry, but it was my ­intervention that seduced them. In it, in doing this, I fashioned a golem that would be cheered to see me destroyed. It’s nothing but a botheration to me. What have I done? What have I done? I did no different, or no differently, with others’ work, and some were supremely grateful for it, and not silent about their debt—Barry Hannah would be such a person. But Hannah, dear Barry, he was a mensch and a half.

This wasn’t the only time I’ve stumbled over Lish’s footprints in stories I love. In an interview with the Paris Review ([The Art of Fiction No. 223](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6303/the-art-of-fiction-no-223-joy-williams)), Joy Williams remarks:

> Lish cut one of my stories, “The Lover,” in half and made it a very good story. He didn’t talk a lot about your stories, he didn’t explain what or why, he just cut and cut.

This was enough to extend my curiosity in Carver and Williams’ spare, strange stories to a curiosity in Lish as an editor. And Lutz’s remarks on Lish’s teaching made me more curious still.

## Lish’s Writing Seminar

I searched for some record of Lish’s writing classes, hitting, mostly, dead ends and dead links, until I found, in the Internet Archive, a copy of [Tetman Callis’s Notes from Gordon Lish’s Writing Seminar in the Fall of 1990](../info/gordon_lish_seminar_notes.md), which I’ve mirrored here on this website as a bulwark against future bitrot.
