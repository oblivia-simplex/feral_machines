yeah. oh it reminds me that there's a great theory piece to be
written about how faeries are always simultaneously pre-human
and post-human. like, they're both closer to the animalistic
(pointy ears and whatnot, forests) and hyper-technological,
hyper-cultural. in d&d the paradox was negotiated away by 
distinguishing high elves and wood elves, but obviously that's
wrong and misses the whole point

it necessitated the drow, as the true synthesis!
the drow are the return of the repressed identity of high elves
and wood elves. 
see, i can still do freudo-hegelianism!

Peli Grietzer [5:58 PM]

omg, yes, like, they're even more cultured than high elves,
and then, they live in fucking caves and are matriarchal,
literally cave people!

fuck, this... actually works

and they transform their criminals into spider-creatures! who 
resemble their highest goddess! driders!

Peli Grietzer [6:00 PM]

so, like, not even the higher animals but the lower animals?

---

yup!

a drider is a spider centaur, more or less. torso of a drow
(usually male), lower half being an enormous spider

but here's the thing, the drow goddess also has that form!

lucca this is so good, i don't even feel like this is a 'lol you
can do freudo-hegelianism to anything' riff, it literally works
