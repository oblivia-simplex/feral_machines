# The Geese

"Oh, it's not *magic*, you flatterer -- it's scarcely *music!*" she'd said, as she unscrewed each antennae from the ghostly instrument and placed each delicate piece into its corresponding cavity in the velvet-lined case. I pleaded her not to be modest, that I'd never, *ever*, heard anything like it. And I'm sure that I went on like that, rambling like a man who wakes from anaesthesia with that delusory sense of lucidity. "An enchantress!" she laughed, and I blushed to hear what I'd been saying. The auditorium had mostly emptied, with a clot of the curious hanging round the exit. A tall man in tweed looked as if he were trying not to laugh as he bent down to mutter something to the fur-clad lady at his side, her hat hardly higher than his elbow. 

"Please, you have to tell me how you do it! You must!" I whispered, suddenly aware of my volume.

She told me that I must come, someday, and visit her at the conservatory in St. Erme. She insisted, ignoring my protests, that she had nothing to teach me, but that if I was truly curious, if I wanted to learn what was possible with this strange apparatus, I would come and meet her son. "He is a prodigy," she said, with a little shake of her head, and looked down at her feet, or at mine. 

I offered to see her off to the train, and she graciously allowed it, permitting me to carry the heavy case to which she'd entrusted her instrument. I was surprised at *how* heavy it was, though I don't know what I'd expected. I suppose I'd let myself indulge in a phantasy that she'd been summoning ghosts from the air and entreating *them* to sing with her gestures -- her delicate, mysterious gestures!

She was very much a woman who spoke with her hands, and I stole every glimpse of them I could manage, her condensed breath whirling in the January air, on the long walk to the Gare du Nord. I was completely absorbed, and she'd startle me now and then by shouting "look out!" and save me from colliding with a pedestrian or a bicycle or a young, haggard mother of triplets pushing an enormous, triple-width pram through the slush with the quiet determination of an ox. "You must watch where you are going, dear boy! It is a delicate machine you are carrying!" But with every interruption, my memory of the conversation would dissolve like a dream. A son, a conservatory, the exhilirating news that she'd been ten years a widow, a plea to dispense with "Mme Ruabon" and just call her "Vivienne", instead. Pouring over the memories of that walk in my icy, ill-furnished apartment I castigated myself for recalling so little, hardly a handful of facts. I felt so keenly embarassed by every word that escaped me, that had slipped through my coarse and clumsy net, that less than two hours later I was unable to preserve in this journal. An incompetent lepidopterist! All I had left was the lilt of her voice and the luminous, luminous skin of her neck, that glowed in that precious winter hour like the window of a church, surrendered to the powers of the flesh. "This is why I *must* become a musician!" I cried and was met with the thumps of a broom, again, against the wafer-thin ceiling below. 

University consumed the next three months, and even as the days grew as long as the nights they seemed to flake away without notice. There were moments of the keenest impatience and longing for spring, when I'd intended to take the train to see Vivienne -- Vivienne and her prodigious son, whose name always seemed to escape me -- but they were, I confess, self-inflicted, like in the hours before sleep when I'd summon the memory and light up the phantasies and hold them like match in a game of *beat the devil*.

On the first day of spring and the last of exams, I hurried from the examination hall with my overstuffed knapsack, packed the night before with a change or two of clothes, a shaving kit and toothbrush, and a couple of overdue library books -- the *Epistola* of Petrus Peregrinus and  Bergson's *Matière et mémoire*, both fated to be left on the train and forgotten -- and forty minutes later I arrived at the station, reeking of sweat and sick with thirst, my corduroy jacket balled under my arm. My glasses were fogged from exertion and I cursed as I stole precious seconds to wipe them down with the sodden tail of my shirt. But I caught my train despite it all and collapsed in a damp and panting heap in an empty aisle seat beside woman wearing a veil, whose posture immediately tightened.

The heat and womblike throb of the train left me drowsy. I couldn't bear to bother the widow more than my presence visibly had, and the window was hers to leave shut. I tried to read a chapter of Bergson but caught myself dozing again and again as a sickening snap of the neck brought me me back to my upright position. Half-read pages mixed with quickly forgotten dreams. 

It was just by dumb luck that I woke up at Leon -- sprawled across the seat where the widow'd been sitting, my spine at an ugly angle. I scrambled to my feet and made for the exit, all the while trying to untangle my jacket and locate the ticket that had slipped somewhere between the corduroy exterior and the sleek nylon lining. I noticed for a moment how much lighter I felt as I ran up and down the stairs at the Leon station to find my connecting train. The why of this only struck later. 

---

The light of the day was golden by the time I arrived in St. Erme and the air had mercifully cooled. There was even a bit of a breeze. I smoothed out my jacket the best that I could, I tucked in my shirt and removed and refastened my tie. Examining my reflection in the window of a parked Citroën, I did what I could with my bedraggled hair, which admittedly wasn't much. It was then that I noticed the diaphanous, counterfeit moustache that I had, to my shame, neglected to shave, and that I would now be forced to bear until I could somehow obtain a new shaving kit. 

I withdrew the still-damp map from my pocket and unfolded it with a reckless jitter that made it quietly rip at the creases. I didn't have far to go. A couple kilometers, if I remember right, though it turned out to be all uphill. I paced myself, anxious to keep my composure. The sun was low, and the walk was shady, a canopy of trees overhanging the road, many fully in flower. A patch of mint sprawled across a long stretch of roadside ditch and freshened the air as I stepped through it. I picked myself a bunch of it and idly chewed on the leaves as I walked, hoping to improve my breath, but my mouth was so dry that it was hard to swallow and all those bits of leaf were clinging to my teeth like plaster. In what I considered a stroke of genius, in the moment, I twisted the remaining mint to release its aroma, loosened my tie and unbuttoned my shirt and then smeared the paste in my armpits.

By the time I arrived at the conservatory -- its narrow, gated driveway complete obscured by the foliage until you were right in front of it -- my shirt was stained with chlorophyl and my armpits itching like mad, but I was determined to salvage my dignity. To whatever extent possible pre-shower, anyway.

The cast-iron gate was unlocked and opened onto a grassy courtyard that was balding in patches and crossed here and there with deep tire tracks into which opalescent waters had gathered. The ground was spongey and wept underfoot and strewn with muddy feathers. The bald spots of the lawn were spattered with lumps of green, black and white, and I could hear a raucous cacophony of honks in the distance, or in what seemed like the distance, as if they were echoing across the Grand Canyon. (I had never actually *been* to the Grand Canyon, but I used to imagine it often.) I looked up and saw nothing but the sky, almost dark, now, with the nearly full moon rather bright and the sun probably just having set, beneath an unseen horizon behind me.

As for the conservatory itself, what wasn't hidden from view had the look of a convent or monastery that had long since fallen from the Church's attention and for some time gone without maintenance. All of the windows on the building's third floor were covered with graying sheets of plywood, and the robin's egg paint on the stucco -- which only reached as high as the second row of windows -- was in the process of flaking away. A thick carpet of ivy had fallen away -- or perhaps had just been pulled -- from off of the north wing's wall and piled in curls on the ground. <!-- wording? "heap" is the wrong word -->

I walked from one door to the next, careful to avoid the bird droppings, peeking in windows for signs of my host, and shouted her name when my knocks went unanswered. 

An engine somewhere growled and coughed, getting higher in pitch and louder until I was ready to plug my ears, and then lowered to a steady rumble: a yellow Citroën idled outside the narrow gate -- which I'd earlier neglected to close -- and went dead. With a rattling cough the ignition turned over and it crept through the gate, its mirrors scraping the granite. The vehicle clanked and teetered as it drove over the uneven lawn and then came to a stop on a greasy patch of earth. <!-- Headlights! -->

The door on the driver's side opened and out stepped an androgynous figure who marched towards me at such a speed that I stumbled back without thinking onto something slick and awful and recovered my balance only by flailing my arms like a windmill, and knocked their glasses clean off. 

"Fucking suck a fucking cockhole!" <!-- not sure about this, the tone feels a bit off -->

She spoke English. And she had what I think was an American accent. Her hair was cut short and thinning a little and she was dressed like an English dandy, with a double-breasted coat and a ruffled blouse that elsewhere might have looked feminine. Four other figures rushed out of the car, and a gnomish little man with a face engulfed in an explosion of curly dark hair ran towards us, rattling off something in Mestreechs. (Flemish I assumed at the time, having never been north of Liège, but I would later be sternly corrected.) The androgynous woman replied in kind and he started searching the grass for her glasses. I was about to try to help him when I was blinded by an electric torch from the car.

"Was that you? The gate?" said the American. I admitted it was, and apologised. She said that it needed to stay shut, and I apologised again. She said that she doesn't need me to be sorry, just for the gate to stay shut. I apologised again out of reflex, squinting.

Whoever had the torch then relented, turned it towards the grass, and the search resumed. I made a show of helping but was still seeing spots, and only succeeded in getting that slippery muck on my hands.

Once the ruckus had settled, I introduced myself, and said I was there on Vivienne's invitation. I learned they were students, of a sort, at the conservatory, or visiting scholars, or "something like that," as the American said. She was no less evasive when I asked her her name, and would act as if she hadn't quite heard me. It seemed that the gnomish man -- who politely introduced himself as Knud, in more or less serviceable French -- appeared to address her as "G" and not merely to be clearing his throat. This seemed to be consistent with what I heard from the others, on the few occasions we spoke. 

---

The honking cacophany exploded in volume the moment G opened the door and only then did it occur to me that I was perhaps hearing music, and that I should keep an open mind. Anxious to avoid interaction with G, I asked Knud if he knew where I could find the loo. 

I was dizzy with thirst and feeling utterly foul as I followed Knuth's rather lengthy directions through the dimly lit labyrinthine halls. The air had a smell to it that I couldn't quite place, between freshly cut grass and mouldering cheese. The stairwell, which seemed harshly lit after the gloomy hallway, was spattered with the same green and black droppings I'd stepped in outside. Knowing relief was imminent made everything unbearably urgent. I clutched the railing -- aware only later of the muck on my hands -- and clambered up the stairs by twos and threes, bowels throbbing and eyes on the ground. 

The WC was an oasis.

---

The foyer was empty by the time I'd returned, feeling human again at last, and I noticed then that the noise -- the music? best to keep an open mind -- had died down. I noticed a light in a doorway a little further down and heard the whistle of a kettle and for want of anything better to do, I walked towards it.

It was a kitchen, outfitted with a jumble of appliances and an enormous steel table -- speckled with dents but surgically clean -- in which the fairy lights that circled the room were reflected. Bundles of sage and lavender hung from the ceiling and overpowered the smell from the halls. Perched on a stool at the end of the table was G, with a mortar and pestel to one side, a kettle to the other, and a tall German mug in her hands. I took a clouded glass from the drying rack and filled it with water from the tap and drained in a single gulp. I was bracing myself to break the silence and ask G if she knew where I could find Vivienne -- who, after all, had invited me -- when Vivienne herself appeared. 

"Allo, G! Did you have any trouble?" she said, in heavily accented English, and the two of them went on to converse for a while about the each of the other guests as I waited to greet my hostess and an unwelcome urgency returned to my bowels. The initial humiliation of feeling unseen gave way to voyeuristic impulse, and with no gaze to meet mine I was free to stare like a cretin. She was perhaps somewhat older than I had first imagined. Had the stage lights and makeup just made her seem younger? But, no, I decided it was something else altogether: that the vision of her playing that ethereal instrument, her hands caressing some invisible field, had lifted her out of the realm of corruption. Her body had appeared to me as the medievals imagined the body of Christ: as something incorruptible, subject to neither age nor decay. And in this light, the infinitely delicate trellis of wrinkles that traced, on her face and neck, the intricate history of her flesh obscured nothing. I was seeing her again at last! 

Vivienne was midsentence when she noticed me and clapped her hands together: "Sebastian! How long have you been here?" I shrugged and apologised though I don't know for what and explained I arrived with the others, that is, that I arrived when they did, that I walked from the station, and that, of course, it's no bother at all, I was happy to walk. I was tripping over my words and grinning like an idiot and at some point G must have got up and left, leaving the two of us to sit at the table.

I was bursting with questions! I wanted to know everything there was to know about her ethereal instrument worked, how I could learn to perhaps even play it, if it wouldn't be impertinent to ask, I had a tangled skein of questions to ask about electromagnetism and the *élan vital* and how our bodies invisibly occupied space and, secretly, inwardly, whether this all might have something or other to do with how the purest erotic pleasure is found in the space before skin touches skin, and how Being might somehow disclose itself in the bodily, the, oh god, the ethereal bodily...  *music*, the *bodily music of the ether*, the incorporeal body of a musician, *her* body! O incorporeal body! O Vivienne! And oh even *now* the words are a jumble!

And as I was fumbling with this intangible tangle of yarn in my head and looking for an end to grab hold of, for some sentence I could say without blushing, she said, "So you have come here to meet my son! To see him play!"

I nodded. It was the first time, in truth, I'd even *thought* of her son since our meeting in the theatre in winter. Three months of mumbling her name to myself before falling asleep, of researching the metaphysics of music and magnets and matter, and I had forgotten that she had a son, that her very words to me, the form of her invitation took was: "You must come and meet my son!" she had said. "*He is a prodigy!* A true prodigy!"

"You must be anxious to meet him!" she clapped her hands together and said, as if to demonstrate human opacity.

I nodded again, every bit as stupidly.

She took me by the hand -- *my hand in her hand!* -- and as I thought about how at a certain age the skin on a woman's hand begins to feel as soft as chalk, feels so astonishingly delicate, like the wing of a moth! When does that happen? It could only be gradual. Is it the contrast between touch and vision that gets us?  That what looks like it will feel somehow rough or uneven feels so very much the opposite it that it shocks us? -- as I got lost in these thoughts she led me down one gloomy, earthy-smelling corridor after another, and up another stairwell, and then down another hallway lined in gyprock and apparently of newer construction, and then down another flight of stairs, until we were standing at an archway before tall mahogany doors. She knocked.

Just as I had imagined Vivienne younger, so had I imagined her son, to the extent I imagined him at all. When she mentioned him in the theatre, the boy who lept to mind couldn't have been older than 12. But the man -- the man! -- the man who answered the door, I'm sure it wasn't him. He was considerably older than me! Vivienne was so delicate that it was hard to imagine the man before me as bearing of any relation to her at all. I had to tilt my head up to look at him, in a way that made me feel like a child. His neck had the girth of my thigh and plunged into a dense tangle of hair, which his half-unbuttoned shirt exposed. His eyes had a look of drowsiness to them that soon learned was deceptive. Each movement seemed to announce an intention from which bodily interference was absent. He was *perfectly alert* -- but with eyelids too heavy to entirely lift or too thick to fully retract. Or perhaps that too was deliberate. Perhaps he never *needed* to look up! His dark hair was slicked back with brylcream and he wore a rich and complex cologne whose notes played counterpoint against the staggering smell of a barnyard. He stood, now, in the doorway, his mother's hand in his, her other hand in mine, and this, too, made me feel like a child, and I blushed as I remembered my unshaven peach fuzz moustache and I blushed even harder as I felt myself blush. "Vivi!" he said, in a literally *palpable* bass, "I was just finishing." And then, with careless brutality: "Who is the boy?"

"This is Sebastian," said Vivienne. "He is a very clever young man, and," to me, "A philosopher, you said?" I mumbled something about being a student *of* philosophy, but that I wouldn't presume, blah, blah, blah, but she shook her head and shushed me. "He's a young philosopher and a lover of 'experimental music'," she said that as if she were quoting me, but I truly don't recall every saying it, "and he has come all the way from Paris to meet you!" Which I had already nodded to twice, and I was powerless to undo the lie.

Sylvain held open the door and bid us to enter what I now realized had served as the temple, when the conservatory itself had served as a convent. This suited my initial impression of the place. The surprise came from elsewhere. The moment we stepped inside, there was a wave of ruffling, coming from the direction of the sanctuary. The ruffling crescendoed and then broke out in honks -- isolated sounds at first, watchmen sounding alarms in the dark -- and then, without any gradual buildup, a harsh and riotous clamour. The ruffling sound erupted afresh and a gaggle -- I wanted to say *horde* -- of Canadian geese exploded into view.

---

<!-- Transition needed? Where does this conversation take place? -->

Were they his choir? Orchestra? Instrument? They were in some sense or other his medium but each suggestion I offered had a way of seeming childish or clueless as soon as it tumbled from my mouth. Sylvain would inhale deeply through his nostrils and stroke his forehead with his thumb and two fingers -- I noticed then that two were missing -- his eyes closed and eyebrows raised, as if I were testing his patience. He then lowered his hand and let it bounce ponderously in the air between us, as if he were weighing a small bag of sand. I stopped midsentence. He languidly opened his eyes and told me that, in matters of art, one mustn't have the mind of "*un petit fonctionnaire.*" I felt my face flush and turned to Vivi with a look that must have been pleading but she only smiled and shrugged and shook her head sweetly. 

"He is a visionary," she said. 

She then took me by the arm and led me from the chapel and down to a large linen closet near the entrance. Of the myriad studios we passed on our way only one appeared to be occupied, lit by a single floor lamp. A solitary dancer went through his drills, without music. I thought for a moment that I'd recognized him as one of those who'd arrived in the Citroën that day and I opened my mouth to say something. My desperation surprised me. Here was a man who, *even if* we had ever met at all, we certainly hadn't spoken. If he were to recognize me it could only be as the oaf who made a fool of himself, who had slipped in shit and smacked G in the face. And I was ready to interrupt him for a friendly nod. I stayed quiet.

As did Vivienne, until we had finally come to the linen. She took two folded sheets from the shelves, and a thick wool blanket. "One pillow or two?" she asked. I said that one would be fine, in a truly meaningless display. Dozens and dozens of pillows remained, each of them equally thin. I consoled myself that I could stuff a sweater beneath it, forgetting for a moment what had happened to my bag. "The bedrooms are on the second and third floors," she said. "Take any one that's empty. You may use the kitchen, but do clean up when you're finished. The food in the green refridgerator is communal."

I nodded.

"Until tomorrow!"

Finding an empty room wasn't difficult. There was one across from the lavatory. It was spartan, or, I guess, monastic -- of course -- but was reasonably clean and had a large window that opened on the courtyard. I opened it and leaned out as far as I dared. The cool evening air was a blessing. I stayed there for what seemed like an hour. Knud appeared in the quad with a bag of feed. A goose hopped out a first storey window. Another followed. Soon there were more than I could count, at least without them standing still. Knud slashed the bag open and dumped it, and then tiptoed his way back to the door while the geese honked and hissed, some of them pushing the others away from the feed and others appearing aloofly demure, with the air of a guilty bystander.

I had the sense of having opened a cupboard and then forgetting what it is that I'm looking for. Of forgetting what I was about to say.

As I made my bed and thought about fixing up some dinner from the communal fridge, I noticed that the air in the room still had a rancid note to it. I started to haul the bed closer to the window, and it made a shuddering sound and looked as if it were about to come apart. Feeling a little queasy, I approached the bed from the other side and gave it a shove, wincing at the noise but determined to at least get it over with. With everything set up for sleep, I began to make my way towards the kitchen, but the exhaustion of the day had caught up with me. I returned to my room, climbed into bed, folded my pillow double, and then sank into sleep like a stone.

<!-- probably more verbose than need be, but we can get that on the second pass -->

---

I woke before dawn at the sound of the geese. The kitchen was full of life. The smell of onions and rosemary and the crackle of oil and eggs in the pan had me ready to pounce! The students I'd met yesterday were crowded around the table in a cluster of chairs that barely seemed to fit in the kitchen. As I arrived, a long-limbed girl stood to leave and then hoisted herself up on the counter, climbed over her peers with acrobatic flourish, and passed by me without saying a word. Breakfast was still being served, and as I stood at the door trying to summon the courage and humility to ask for a plate, the slender German dancer that I'd noticed the day before waved me over. I apologetically squeezed behind three occupied chairs to reach the acrobat's seat, giddy with hunger.

I had difficulty making out more than a few words of the conversation -- or the tangled skein of conversations, most of it in irregularly accented French. Sylvain, who was absent, was mentioned often. His name was intoned with enthusiasm, or with something I took to be reverence. I listened carefully for mention of the ubiquitous geese as I devoured my eggs and onions, attentive for some explanation. I caught none. It embarassed me that most of the words I discerned were just the ones echoed in English: *rupture, absolu, subversion, radical...* I wanted to ask about Vivienne (who wasn't there, either) and her electromagnetic instrument, but there was simply no point of entry. 

When the meal was over and the students dispersed, I stayed to help with the dishes, and to thank the girl who'd prepared the eggs. "The eggs were delicious!" I told her, eager to show my appreciation. They had, indeed, been delicious eggs, their flavour rich and deep. She smiled, and then it struck me to ask, "Were they from the geese?"

Her expression was flat and unreadable. Fearing I'd been misunderstood, or that the language was somehow eluding me, I repeated the question. "The eggs, I mean. Were they goose eggs? From the geese you have here?" 

It was only then that I'd seen I'd offended her, that I'd said something terribly wrong.

She put down the stack of dirty plates so abruptly that I thought for a moment they'd shatter. She asked who I was. I felt terribly unsure of myself. I sputtered something about how I was there on Vivienne's invitation, while doubting if that was the point of the question. Numbness began to yield to shame, to an unbearable wave of shame. I tried to say my name and choked.

I returned to my room, shut the door, and at last let myself cry a cry at once wildly disproportionate and necessary. I folded up my glasses and tucked them into my jacket. I recalled, with horror, the state in which I'd left the kitchen. The entire stack of dishes still slick with yolk. I flushed with heat, sloughed off my jacket and stuck my head out the window. The self-congratulatory show I'd made, proudly *volunteering* to wash up! I snuck like a thief to the WC, splashed cold water on my face until I found my composure, and resolved to go back to the kitchen.

On the way back down I rehearsed my apology. It was impossible to quite get right. Each iteration more clueless than the last, each more evasive and phony. My voice sounded syrupy with oblique condescension, compulsively insincere. What had I even said that was so galling? Her contempt for me was baseless! I should be indignant! I tried to egg myself on. It was no use. The baselessness of things gave me vertigo. I looked up.

I no longer knew where I was.

I'd taken a wrong turn or two, or, I suppose, failed to take the right one. It didn't help matters that I'd forgotten my glasses -- folded neatly in the pocket of my corduroy jacket, dumped in a heap on the floor by the window -- but my eyesight wasn't *so* bad back then and I could manage well enough. A wave of relief washed over me. <!--My immediate reaction, in fact, was relief.--> This was, whatever else it was, a problem I could solve! I thought of a trick I'd learned as a kid: all I had to do was keep my left hand -- or right, it doesn't matter -- keep my left hand touching the wall -- at all times -- and follow it right to the end. And I'll get back where I started. Or at arrive at an exit. If I could just get outside, I could walk around the building and get my bearings that way.

In the distance, I could hear Sylvain's geese. I imagined that if I could just train my ear on the resonance, on the acoustic *shape* of that racket, I could suss out the room it was coming from. I imagined myself navigating those caverns like a bat. Released from human embarrassment. I thought of Vivienne's instrument, and how she played the air or the aether around it. The sound seemed distant. The sound of Vivienne's instrument, I mean, seemed very distant in time, and I felt a pang at the thought that after coming all this distance I still hadn't heard her play it. I hadn't, in fact, heard her mention it, her or anyone else. 

Navigating by goose sounds was hopeless. I didn't have the ear for it. I returned my hand to the wall on my right and trudged on, stepping between clusters of goose poop.

I eventually came to a door on my right, and (as required by my method) passed through it. It opened onto a long, narrow hall, with a tile floor that was not only clean but gleaming. The soles of my shoes squeaked as I walked and in the distance I could make out a hunched human figure, wheeling a sloshing yellow bucket behind her. I hurried towards her to ask for directions.

It took me a moment to see who it was, even as she came into focus. Her hair was in a loose gray bun, skewered in place with a paintbrush, and she was draped in a blue janitorial smock -- in its pockets, a scrub-brush and a green can of Comet. When she saw me, she smiled, and said my name.

"Vivienne!" I felt giddy and free, again, at last! "When I can hear you play? I've just been, I've just been so desperate to ask you. Please let me hear you play again -- and do you think, would it be possible, could you show me how? Sorry, I, I'm sorry, I, here, let me, let me help you with the floors!" I grabbed, and released, and again grabbed the mop, she let go and seemed about to say something when I felt my feet go cold in a flash. I'd sloshed the dirty green water all over my shoes and -- "*Sebastian!* " she cried -- I saw that I hadn't spared hers.

She took back the mop and pressed it in the wringer. 

"We will talk later, yes?"

I stood still as she wheeled the bucket away, her shoes squelching, and where the hall formed a T she turned left. I waited a few minutes, and then took a right. It wouldn't do to change the rules now.
