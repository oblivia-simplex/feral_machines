# Introduction 

---

"Ours is a world in vertigo. It is a world that swarms with technological
mediation, interlacing our daily lives with abstraction, virtuality, and
complexity." So begins the Xenofeminist Manifesto, formally Xenofeminism: A
Politics for Alienation (hereafter XFM), compiled by the collective Laboria
Cuboniks in 2015. "XFM constructs a feminism adapted to these realities: a
feminism of unprecedented cunning, scale, and vision; a future in which the
realization of gender justice and feminist emancipation contribute to a
universalist politics assembled from the needs of every human, cutting across
race, ability, economic standing, and geographical position."


The considerations, in short, of Laboria Cuboniks, or LC, are extensive, taking
into account not only the ways in which technology can facilitate pluralistic
feminisms, but also the extent to which technology may constitute an
interdisciplinary means for revising, and ideally revitalizing, discourse about
gendered identity, labour and bodily experience.

This summer, I corresponded with Olivia Lucca Fraser, Halifax-based theorist, scholar
and programmer, and one of the members of Laboria Cuboniks, about her vision for
XFM and some of the implications of technofeminist critique considered more
broadly – including its relation to aesthetics, online discourse, activism and
the stakes of universalist politics. Fraser beat me to the punch with many of
her responses, anticipating questions, for example, about the perceived
inaccessibility of technology. "Free time," she observes, "[may be] the single
biggest obstacle between the current situation and the utopias dreamt up by ‘90s
cyberfeminism." Nevertheless, Fraser's optimism about technology's potential and
her analyses of the manifesto form itself – a kind of experiment, she wagers,
that works best when "you can't predict with any probability who your audience
will be" – provide an optimistic counterpoint to doom-and-gloom accounts of
contemporary surveillance and techno-policing.

As Laboria Cuboniks extol in the final line of XFM: "If nature is unjust, change
nature!" The following conversation considers related efforts to inspire, enact,
critique and renegotiate the pursuit of such changes… - Note: Inspired by the
aphoristic structure of XFM, the interview is divided into five question
clusters: DEFINE, ATTEND, UPEND, EXTEND and MANIFEST. Readers should feel free
to read sequentially or non-sequentially as desired. The full text of XFM is

> Who exactly is Laboria Cuboniks, and is the group still active?

She's no one in particular. But she's still very active.

Those of us who were most immediately behind the manifesto have already been
de-anonymized, so I suppose there's no need to be elusive. Except for one point:
Laboria Cuboniks isn't something we want to be identified with in any rigid way.
We just wanted to get [Laboria] started, and to give people a sense of what it
could mean to speak through, or with, her.

There were six of us at the beginning: Diann Bauer, Katrina Burch, Helen Hester,
Amy Ireland, Patricia Reed and myself. Since then, and even indirectly during
the writing of the manifesto, others became involved . . . Laboria Cuboniks is
meant to be an abstract platform, for which we don't feel we ought to be the
gatekeepers. It's a pseudonym for anyone who's interested in using it. Of
course, it's a bit of a gamble that the results will be consistent or useful,
but it seems like an interesting gamble.

There is no real opposition any more, I don't think. It already feels a bit
quaint or ironic to contrast your "online" with your "real" life. With the rise
of social media, on the one hand, and the decline of the academic humanities, on
the other, the Internet – especially extremely public and accessible zones, such
as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, the blogosphere, etc. – has become the
place where relevant political discourse and theory happens. On the Internet,
discourse [interweaves] with everyday life. Threads routinely bob back and forth
from back-of-the-envelope economic analyses to shitposting, confessionals and
chitchat. It's a whole different ecosystem for ideas and memes . . . In this new
system, ideas need to spread as quickly as the flu to stay viable; they can't
afford to take the time they'd take to spread in an academic ecology (academic
ideas are more like STDs – long-lasting, but requiring far more than casual
contact to spread).

Another twist that the ubiquity of the Internet and social media brought about,
I think, is the way it turns domestic space inside out. It goes a long, long way
to abolishing the separation of public and domestic spheres. Lack of free time
is still a huge obstacle here, but there's something very important about the
way the Internet lets agents who have been traditionally excluded from the
public sphere enter into conversations that can, at least potentially, become
global in scale. The very topology of the public sphere has changed in a way
that makes gatekeeping increasingly unfeasible.

To get back to your question: it's not the dissolution between material and
immaterial that interests me; it's the complexification of public space. I mean
this in a basic topological sense: the world no longer has – or is at least
rapidly shedding – the structure that once made it susceptible to traditional
forms of control: isolation, gatekeeping, censorship, containment, etc. . . The
separation of intellectual and manual labour, of domestic and public spaces, and
so on, presuppose a world with a very different shape than the one we have now.
We've smashed the crystal spheres. New forms of control are arising rapidly,
driven by forms of observation and intelligence that have no historical
precedent, but there's no getting the horse back in the barn, or the stars back
in the firmament.

There's a lot of talk of the modern panopticon and the surveillance state these
days, but in some ways it tends to be too pessimistic: technologies and
governmental practices of surveillance and control might be accelerating, but
they're still losing the race. Thanks to modern encryption and anonymization
technologies, the world is becoming unsurveillable and uncontrollable at an
entirely different, and greater, order of magnitude. Just to give one simple
example: virtually every modern smartphone is equipped with encryption
technology, e.g. Signal, that is strong enough to escape the most powerful
surveillance agencies on the planet. The current pushback that we're seeing in
various governments' attempts to limit or weaken encryption is as inevitable and
as clownish as it looks, but this is a fight that I think they have already
lost.

Yes. "Intersectionality" is a tremendously important notion – it's the insight
that every demographic abstraction is leaky as hell, and that no identity
category captures us without remainder, and that power never operates uniformly,
but adapts itself to every facet of our complexly textured lives. This means
that any grounds we put forth for solidarity are going to risk hardening into
something deceitful and procrustean, or even outright oppressive, if they don't
remain open to a sort of universalism. But [a universalism] that proceeds from
the concrete particularities of the situation. This is a tricky point, because
we also see universalist gestures being used as an excuse to ignore the
situations we're dealing with – "All Lives Matter" being an easily recognizable
example of sham universalism. This isn't an intersectional and genuinely
universalist gesture; it's a retreat, a way of emptying a real struggle of its
content, so as to make it more palatable to those who don't want to be
disturbed.

Yes, absolutely.

"Shaping visions of freedom" is an interesting way to think about aesthetics,
especially those of human self-artificialization, which, admittedly, seems like
an enormously broad category. I don't know if I want to say this as an extremely
general rule, but it seems that most engrossing art gives us a new, sometimes
slightly more nuanced or skewed, sensibility of our freedoms and constraints.

> 11.111 What do you make of the borderline fetishization of 1990s subcultural
> aesthetics (here, I'm thinking of Riot Grrrl, Cyberfeminism, and other forms of
> predominantly white "alt" culture) and attendant critiques of third-wave
> nostalgia in contemporary culture?

Do you mean [Laboria Cuboniks'] fetishization of these aesthetics? I hope we're
not fetishizing them. I think these [subcultures] influenced us at an early age,
so I wouldn't be surprised if you found some echoes there. And Cyberfeminism is
basically our monstrous, ectogenic mom, with whom we're still very close and
call every weekend. Most of us were teenagers in the '90s, and for some of us
that meant hanging out on BBSes,1 listening to punk rock and making drug-addled,
underground zines with ink, glue and Xerox machines.

The question of nostalgia has been raised before, though, regarding XF and
accelerationism, our monstrous sibling… There's definitely a fondness for those
moments in history when the present seemed to bristle with futures. It's not a
nostalgia for what was, but for what seemed possible. We can't let it dominate
our work – you don't want to fixate on these things . . . But there's a genuine
affection for those moments that continues to give us energy and hope.

I guess you can see something that's been called nostalgia in quite a few of the
online aesthetic movements that have formed recently – vaporwave, seapunk,
cybertwee, etc. But I don't think that their enjoyment and estrangements of
older cultural forms is really a problem. It would be more of a problem, I
think, if we let the wreckage of the '90s go to waste without trying to explore
it. . . Part of what it means to be contemporary, to live in 2016, is to look
back on the ruins of the '90s - and now, I suppose, the early 2000s – as history,
as something retro. That's something we couldn't do at the time. And we missed a
lot of things, a lot of strangeness and a lot of stupidity on the first pass.
This is a political exercise, too. Look at how every character in Friends
squirms and panics every time anything even slightly suggestive of homosexuality
comes up. It's bizarre as hell. And it was perfectly normal at the time. Even
straight kids living today can see how bizarre it was. At the time, you had to
have a seat on the margins to see why this was screwy.

The romanticism of '90s cyberculture, for example, can also be tremendously
invigorating. It reminds us of how absolutely fucking remarkable our current era
is. Just look at the excitement you find in authors like Sadie plant, VNS Matrix
and Sandy Stone when they talk about the instant availability of knowledge, the
ubiquity of artificial intelligence and the near total interconnectivity of the
planet. It's too easy to see the present as something banal or unremarkable. As
my friend William Gillis – who was responsible for printing [XFM] as a zine,
which, I'm not going to lie, was so nostalgically satisfying  -  pointed out,
prior to the last couple of decades, humanity was completely fragmented. People,
for the most part, could only communicate with their neighbours, aside from a
few very tenuous connections by phone or mail, usually with people with whom
they already had some local or familial connection. Look forward a few hundred
years, maybe, to the age of interplanetary travel and colonization, and you're
going to see a similar situation on a greater scale: people, for the most part,
will only be communicating with others on the same planet and its satellites.
The 21st century is perhaps the one unique century in human history where
everyone is at least potentially in communication with everyone else, by the
fewest degrees of separation we've ever seen, or will ever see. This is a
remarkable era, and the decade that seemed to have the clearest view of why it
would be remarkable was the '90s. It's not a "let's go back to how things were"
sensibility that makes '90s cyberculture so interesting to us. Rather, it's a
detour for getting to what's so bloody remarkableand new in the present.

There were limitations, too, in what we were exposed to during [the '90s].
Racial and subcultural clustering was an aspect of that. A lot of Black thinkers
and artists were influential for me: Octavia Butler, Samuel Delaney, Jean-
Michel Basquiat and DJ Spooky were all big influences on my weird, late-'90s
self and the sort of art I was interested in making, but the subcultural milieu
I was steeping in probably did skew a bit white. I'm sure there's a lot that I
missed as a result. I'd like to miss less.

## UPEND 

> 111.1 For many, the intersections of technology and feminism inevitably
> recall Donna Haraway and 1990s art activism, or "hacktivism," groups like VNS
> Matrix. What individuals, groups, or projects currently inspire you?

VNS Matrix is one of our biggest influences, which I think is pretty obvious.
One of the really cool things that happened while we were working on the
manifesto was that we became – slightly star-struck at first – friends with
Virginia Barratt (thanks, Internet!), and she was one of the readers who we
bombarded with drafts while the whole thing was still in alpha. Sandy Stone,
Sadie Plant and Nick Land also rank pretty high in terms of influence.

My aesthetic sensibilities – such as they are; I've never been part of the art
world, in the sense of "high" art – were probably shaped in the late '90s and
early 2000s in the underground comics and art scenes in Halifax. I used to paint
a bit and make zines. I was never much good, but it was exciting, and got me
exploring the far aesthetic reaches of strangeness and disorientation. Getting a
taste for the xeno and all that. I learned a lot from Dan Gallant, in visual
art, and Jen Devlin, as a writer. Both of them went on to do far more than I
ever could with painting and poetry.

Currently, [LC's] theoretical influences are mostly friends of ours. Less the
people we study, than the people with whom we communicate on a regular basis, if
we haven't frittered away, then read the writings of, if we haven't frittered
away all our time on the Internet: the "left accelerationists" and
"neorationalists" Pete Wolfendale, Reza Negarestani, Nick Srnicek and Alex
Williams; Benedict Singleton, with whom we've gotten into long conversations
about traps, cunning, and interplanetary colonization; William Gillis, who we
met more recently, and who represents the anarcho-transhumanist camp; Alain
Badiou, [who] influenced our thinking about categories like universalism; and
Dominic Fox. Susan Blackmore and Scott Alexander have shed a tremendous light on
the topic of memetics, which has been something I've been spending a lot of time
with lately. The artist Alina Popa has been a huge influence on the question of
thinking about estrangement aesthetically. And, of course, all of those in
Laboria Cuboniks have been a constant source of insight and provocation.

> 111.11 Do you think that the interdisciplinarity of network systems and the

It's definitely making it easier for anyone – as far as time and energy allow,
which is never far enough – to participate in multiple spheres at once. It's
easier for a software developer to find an audience for their poetry, for
philosophers to learn to code, for scientists to engage in political activism,
etc. The old information silos are crumbling. Time is the biggest obstacle now.
Most of us aren't pampered renaissance men, and so even though we can easily
pick up a free online course to learn X, and can write a blog that will likely
have a wider readership than most prestigious academic journals, most of us are
also pretty damn frazzled and tired most of the time, especially if we're
raising kids or living in poverty or both. Free time is really the single
biggest obstacle between the current situation and the utopias dreamt up by '90s
cyberfeminism.

Absolutely. I transitioned from academia (philosophy, specifically) to tech
(computer science, information security, and AI in particular) around the same
time [LC] began working on the manifesto, so I was definitely in the process of
discovering an incredibly rich conceptual vocabulary and an entirely new expanse
of potential metaphors. I work in [information security] full-time now and
tinker with machine learning on the side, and I'm still finding this to be the
case. It's a beautiful and fascinating world: the world of the electron and the
switch, the beauty of the baud and so on… I think you can certainly engage with
self-representation and gender without also being a computer hacker. Different
people learn different things at different speeds, so it's unfair to say that
anyone can dive in and feel at home in the bowels of the technosphere. But it's
also never been easier to learn – the only real obstacle seems to be time – and
those who are curious enough about it will feel themselves drawn into it. Just
as those who are curious enough about refashioning their subjectivity, or their
sex, will find ways and means of doing so. And there's a certain sense of
"radicalism" that just is this curiosity, this restlessness, this desire to get
to the root of everything and figure out how it works and how it can be changed.
It's not really surprising, for example, that there's a disproportionately large
overlap between computer hackers and trans people. You're unlikely to try to
hack your own endocrine system and radically rebuild yourself as a social and
embodied subject if you don't have a bit of restless radicalism in you. It's not
surprising if the same sensibility eventually has you reverse engineering
software and searching for exploits. This is just one example, of course. Art
and science are others.

## EXTEND

> iv.1 How is digital feminist allyship enactable? In your mind, are the politics
> of this form of feminism significantly different than the politics of activism
> in "real life"?

If someone wants to be an "ally," that's cool, and it usually means they mean
well. But it's an inherently weak position to occupy, and I think that sometimes
it risks coming off as a bit patronizing – as if what feminists need are a bunch
of dutiful yes-men. I think it's better just to focus on respect, friendliness
and egalitarianism. What's necessary, and sometimes lacking, in online
communications is patience and respect, not deference and kowtowing.

One major difference between IRL (AFK?) [2] activism – or forming activist
communities – and its online counterpart comes down to bandwidth. When you're
interacting with someone face-to-face, you've typically got much more
information to process. This can make it much more strenuous for some, but it
also makes certain complexities and nuances clearer, even if they can't be
unambiguously parsed. Interaction online is optimized for speed, and, at its
worse, for achieving the most dramatic, noisiest reaction in the shortest time,
on a strictly economized band of information (maybe just 140 characters or
less). Two dominant kinds of behaviour evolve as a result: one which learns to
dispatch discipline and shame with utmost efficiency while avoiding
excommunication, and one which learns to completely desensitize themselves from
all that, and which spreads by triggering and exploiting the other side's
disciplinary reflexes instead. It's an unstable set-up. #gamergate was probably
the high-water-mark for both tendencies, and, from a certain, systemic
perspective, it's very interesting to look at. It's hard to imagine these
particular forms of behaviour evolving, or at least becoming dominant memetic
species, offline. I'm not trying to valorize offline communities or denigrate
online communication. We've just got different traps and attractors to avoid in
each case.

Given that these are probably the two least productive and empowering forms of
communication online – trolling and uncharitable callouts – I suppose that
"digital allyship" would mean trying to communicate in a way that isn't overly
prone to either. I know that "be nice, treat people as equals, and show respect
and humility" is pretty boring, liberal-sounding advice, but it's what I've got.

> iv.1i Another passage of XFM reads: "Why is there so little explicit, organized
> effort to repurpose technologies for progressive gender political ends? XF seeks
> to strategically deploy existing technologies to re-engineer the world."

What kinds of projects have arisen so far in response or relation to XF? XF is
still very young, and I think it's still pretty obscure, so I don't want to
overstate its influence on the ground. But one project that definitely deserves
mention is Open Source Gendercodes [3], a project founded by Ryan Hammond, which
aims to develop genetically modified tobacco plants that produce significant
quantities of human-compatible sex hormones. The technology, once developed,
would be made completely open source, with the aim of ensuring a means of
directly accessing cross-sex (or same sex) hormones. We were pretty ecstatic
when we stumbled across Hammond's project, online – and even more so when one of
us caught a glimpse of the XF manifesto pinned to his studio wall in his
crowdfunding video!

We've also been happy to see artists and writers pick up XF and run with it.
There's a group in the UK, for example, that put together a xenofeminist
exhibition. [4] "3rdspace is a response to XF and an exploration into the powers
of technology to escape modern structures of control," their statement reads.
"As artists we are trying to reprogram the world's code and reengineer new
ones."

## MANIFEST

I think that most of the manifestos [LC are] interested in contain an element of
identity destabilization. The Cyberfeminist and Bitch Mutant Manifestos of VNS
Matrix were less about celebrating feminine identity than about laughing at an
obsolete patriarchy's increasingly incompetent efforts to restrain anything in a
stable identity marked "woman." At first, the Hacker and Cyberpunk manifestos
appear like identitarian litanies – the first with its chorus "we're all alike"
and the second with its opening declaration "We are…" In both cases, though, the
evoked identity slips between the cracks as something misjudged and
unrecognized.

It seems like even the most identity-focused manifestos involve some gesture of
disidentification. From start to finish, "A Cyborg Manifesto" [5] is a
celebration of everything that slips through the gridwork of recognizable
identities. I suppose that most manifestos contain something like this
double-movement: destabilizing identities on the one hand so as to restabilize a
different configuration of identities on the other. The really intriguing
[manifestos] make the most of the gap between these two moments. 

> v.1i On a formal level, do you think manifestos have a unique capacity to
> operate as sites of self-evidence? Is there a radicality to such a mode of
> citation that is perhaps essential to the work of 21st century feminism?

I don't think a manifesto can claim self-evidence. Generally speaking, if you
feel like you've been convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt by a manifesto,
you've probably been played like a rhetorical fiddle. [Manifestos] are not
meticulously developed argumentative pieces. They're more like stand-up comedy
[in that] their job is to point things out . . . [t]o nudge you into adopting a
point of view that might not have seemed available beforehand, but which pulls
things into focus in a way that makes you want to run with [an idea] and see
where it goes. 

> v.ii1 Do you consider the manifesto a prefigurative form?

Manifestos are only really prefigurative if you can't predict who your audience
will be. The opposite of a manifesto is a conference paper. The most difficult
part of writing these things is keeping questions open, not falling too deeply
into old habits (e.g. academic or art world habits). The whole point of writing
something like [a manifesto] is to try to reshape the discursive chessboard, at
least in some small but structural way, and not just to move the existing pieces
around.
