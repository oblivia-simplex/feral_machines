# Slime

In the third installment of a series on coding, ontology, and sorites-like
problems, which has been unfolding between The Last Instance and
Conflated Automatons, Adam writes:

This got me thinking about the (rather pulpy) imagery that I used when
I introduced [ROPER](http://roper.eschtronics.ca), imagery that made it into the title of my thesis:
*Urschleim in Silicon: Return Oriented Program Evolution with ROPER*.
