# Documentation

## This folder controls the Feral Machines blog

Posts in the `./posts/` subdirectory will be synced with the blog server, at https://feralmachin.es. A `draft` tag prevents those posts from being displayed on the blog's table of contents (home page), but they're still accessible online to anyone who knows, or stumbles across the URL.

## Git submodule

The blog directory contains a separate git submodule, which points to the remote repo at `git@github.com:oblivia-simplex/feral_machines.git`, which is currently public. Which means that this folder note is also public. 

## The `sync_notes.sh` script

The synching is controlled by a `sync_notes.sh` script, that runs as a minutely cronjob. The threshold is set to 600 seconds, which means that a sync only occurs if there has been no file activity (including autosaves) in the notes directory, or any of its subdirectories, in the last 10 minutes. This can be adjusted as needed.
